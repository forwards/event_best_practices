Your presentation is an advert for your poster. People that are interested will want to know your name and poster number so they can follow up in the poster session or at a later time. Therefore
 - Include your name and poster number on your slide
 - State your name and poster number at the start of your presentation
 
When creating the poster
 - Design graphics with high contrast and with attention to ensuring contrasts are visible to people with various types of colorblindness. [we could expand on this/link to further resources]
 - Add alternative text descriptions to graphs, plots, and flow charts, which are usually not accessible.(Goring et al, 2018)
 
 
TO BE EXPANDED ON:

Provide poster in both markdown and PDF for inclusion on the website *prior* to conference. Markdown will probably need to be a recommendation as I expect many people use other ways to produce a poster. Providing a guide to packages/examples might encourage adoption.
