Purpose: propose a short Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI) recommendation list for meetup organisers

Effective DEI strategies for Meetups should take into account their nature:
- This is a community that meets periodically, not a one-off event, and develops a culture and atmosphere over time
- The organisers are often a small number of volunteers, dedicating some of their free time, and not large or robust organisations
Thus recommendations should be easy to implement by one person, not require a lot of time and resources, and take into account long term impact

First of all, keep asking yourself the following questions:
- Who are your events by?
- Who are you events for? 
- How are they for them?
- Who is in your events?
Considering these questions from a DEI perspective. Take into account what you would like the community it be, and what the current community make up is.

To get started here are a few high impact, and low effort, recommendations that are relevant for meetups.

Please note: in the current draft I mention women as an example, but the recommendations are valid for all marginalised and minority groups. 

- Have women organisers: Prioritising diversity starts with you
  - The organising team makeup should reflect the diversity you aspire to create in your community!
  - The more marginalised and minority groups you have represented in your organisation team the better
  - Organising meetups is a great leadership and networking opportunity, and it should not appear to be exclusive 
  - It will provide the entire organising team with practical DEI learning opportunities as they learn to work together, and share their expriences, networks, and ideas
- Have 50%+ women on stage (and don't count moderators)
  - Providing a venue for women to share their work and experience is a great way to support their careers 
  - It means you have to be proactive about finding speakers and experts, beyond your network
  - Don't look for a "certain kind" of speaker, and welcome lesser-known speakers
  - Reach out to your community and wider network for ideas, suggestions, and introductions
  - There are many resources that can help you go beyond your network, like:
    - https://rladies.org/directory/
    - Asking women in your community if they can share your call for speakers in their networks (slack channels/twitter accounts/etc.)
    - https://wimlds.org
    - https://www.dogsandshoes.com/2012/06/getting-women-and-other-under-represented-people-to-speak-at-your-conference-is-hard-so.html
- Advertise via womenâ€™s networks
  - Don't just post your event on meetup and twitter and hope women will find out about it
  - Proactively seek women in your community and ask them where you can post to reach them and other women
  - If they mention private women's network or channel, ask them if they would post the invitation on your behalf
- Rewrite you event invitation, call for speakers and general communication with inclusive language
  - Consider the specific wording of how you solicit talks, e.g. call for "People who have advice or expertise to share" rather than "experts" or "speakers"
  - Avoid stereotypes
  - Be transparent that you want a broad & diverse group to share their expertise
  - If your meetup has a long history, and you're trying to change what it's like, be up front about the kinds of people you want to have speak and attend, why, and how this may look different from the past.
  - See https://numfocus.org/blog/inclusive-approaches-to-recruitment-outreach-notes-from-the-disc-unconference for more details on the above
  - Pay attention to the photos you use to advertise your event, e.g. what do people look like who attend?
- Code of conduct for attendees, sponsors, speakers, organisers, etc.
  - Have one. You can write it yourself or use one of the many publicly available ones (Forwards, R-Ladies, etc.)
  - Inform your community about it, e.g. mention it in your meetup intro, hang it up in the space and include it in your meetup page
  - Be clear about the contact point for CoC concerns
  - Enforce it
- Have events for women (not necessarily exclusive)
  - Periodically organise an event dedicating to showcasing, supporting, and developing, the women in your community
  - Don't make this about "women's topics" but about promoting women's contribution within your community
  - It can be an easy and clear way to communicate that you are DEI minded
- Stay open-minded and curious about what else you can to do 
   - Ask your attendees and speakers what they need, there might be something you can easily do to accommodate them
    - "Do you need any special accommodations to help make your time at the meetup comfortable and productive? (e.g. accessibility considerations). Please email and include the details of your request."
   - Ask your community for ideas, speaker and topic suggestions, or an open invitation to reach out to you and share their experience
   - Survey participants after the event to establish whether your diversity and inclusion measures had an effect.
- Gender-Neutral Bathrooms (this is from https://github.com/numfocus/DISCOVER-Cookbook/blob/master/02_minimal_measures.md)
  - Post signs in the restroom and/or on the door instructing what to do if you think someone is in the "wrong" restroom
    - "If you think someone's gender doesn't match the sign on the door, please follow these steps: Don't worry about it, they know better than you." (via @LGBTplusBristol)
  - Ensuring your meetup has easily accessible gender-neutral restrooms is a simple way to help non-binary and trans individuals feel included and welcome at your meetup and community
- Catering
  - If you or your venue are providing food and drinks, consider dietary and religious restrictions
  - Some people have severe allergies or dietary restrictions that can affect their ability to attend the meetup
  - Label food and beverages that are for a small part of the community and ask people to respectful make sure they are available to those that need them
- Mobility
  - Reserve seats in rooms for folks who might need it (wheelchair, crutches, cane, etc.). Choose easily-accessible seats, such as at the end of a row on the aisle.
  - Create wide aisles between chairs to make it easier for people who are mobility-impaired to navigate the room.
