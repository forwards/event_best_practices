<h1> Event Best Practices for Inclusion of Disabled and Deaf Participants

<h2> Goals of Inclusion

Inclusion goes beyond accessibility.

* Inclusion is for everyone, not just people who request specific types of access.
Participants with invisible disabilities should not have to out themselves. Lots
of people have disabilities and neurodivergence that aren't obvious.

* Everyone is welcome and their contributions valued. Access is not a liability or burden.
The outmoded phrase "special needs" suggests that the need for access is the disabled individual's,
rather than the organizers' responsibility. Avoid euphemisms like "special" and
"challenged" when talking about disability. Be matter of fact, and follow each
individual's preference for how they identify their disability and what kind of
help they need. 

<h2> Overall logistics

The conference website should be accessible to people with various disabilities as
specified in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG; https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). It should detail the inclusive practices that will
be used at the conference so people can decide whether the conference will be accessible enough to attend. There should be a contact listed for questions about
accessibility.

Provide a summary of the venue's accessibility. Information could include

   * number and location of accessible restrooms
   * availability of elevators
   * walking distance from venue to hotel(s) and other locations for conference-related social events
   * accessible ground transportation options

Bear in mind that presenters might have disabilities. Ensure that they
will have access to stages, podiums, panel seating, and microphones.

Some people with disabilities travel with assistants. These assistants should not have to pay to register.

<h2> Sensory Accessibility

Conference presentations and tutorials are made on both visual
(slides) and auditory channels: the slides and the presenter's spoken words. For
deaf, hard-of-hearing (HoH), blind, and low vision participants, integrating
these two channels so that all
information can be understood simultaneously can be difficult without
inclusive practices.

Sign language interpreting is required for some potential
participants. Since UseR! 2020 is in the United states, ASL (American
sign language) interpreters should be available. For conferences in
other locations, the local sign language would be relevant. Deaf
participants should be able to sit near interpreters, and they should
be able to watch the interpreter, the presenter, and the screen simultaneously.
Interpreters must be available for social activities such as breaks
and meals for full access to the conference environment.
THe Environmental Science Department at St. Mary's University
has a website with specific guidance for working with interpreters
conferences and a variety of related situations:
https://smu.ca/academics/departments/environmental-science-work-with-interpreter.html


Live captioning can provide access to spoken content for some
participants. It could also be used to provide transcripts of talks later.
While some deaf/HoH people can use both sign language and captioning, others
can only use one or the other.

The sound system at the venue should have the audio induction loop system that
can send signals directly to hearing aids. The availability of this
system should be posted on a sign at the entrance to the room, along
with specifications if only a certain part of the room is covered.

Small breakout rooms should be located near the conference sessions
and break areas to provide quiet places for conversations without
background noise.

Everyone should be required to use a microphone. If it's impractical
to amplify people asking questions, the presenter or moderator should
repeat the questions into a microphone.

Loud music at events can make it difficult for some to participate.

Requesting presentations early (preferably in markdown) and making
them available electronically will enable blind people to use screen
reading software or braille displays to follow the details (e.g. code)
of talks. Slides should be prepared avoiding the use of small fonts
and attention given to choosing colors that are visible to people with color
blindness. Recommendations can be found on the Perkins School for the
Blind website:
https://www.perkinselearning.org/technology/digital-transitions/creating-accessible-powerpoint-presentations-students-visual
High-contrast color schemes are more visible.  Large print hard copies
of talks could be more accessible for visually impaired participants.
Alt-text descriptions should be used for graphics, images, memes, screenshots,
and other graphically-presented material.

Presenters should be guided to pace themselves so the audience can
integrate both audio and visual information. Graphics, pictures,
videos, and memes should be described audibly.

At meals and breaks, someone should be available to help blind and
low vision people to navigate food and beverage
choices. Braille labels can be provided.

Avoid dividing people into groups based on color-coded items.
Use additional sensory hints like "Group One is Blue."

Avoid bright and/or flashing lights or images that could trigger seizures.

<h2> Inclusive Practices around Food

Provide a wide range of foods including gluten- and allergen-free, as
well as vegetarian/vegan, options. Make ingredient lists available, and have
someone from the catering service available for questions.

To avoid contamination with gluten or allergens at buffets, serve each
food on separate plates or containers (e.g. do not contaminate cheese
with crackers). Use the layout or decorations to discourage
contamination of utensils. Place gluten- or allergen-containing foods
later in the buffet so they don't contaminate allergen-free foods
earlier in the sequence.

Lunch and break times should be long enough for people to leave the
conference to get the food they need if it is not available at the
conference.

Sugar free beverage options (diet soda, etc. and sweetners like Stevia, Equal,
Sweet 'N' Lo) are needed at breaks, as well as plain water.

If free alcohol is provided, have something other than beer and have non-alcoholic options.

<h2> Inclusive Physical Space
* This section is weak *

Information should be available on the locations of accessible bathrooms, break areas,
lactation rooms, and meeting rooms.
This would be important for lecture halls that have entrances at different levels.

Ensure that aisles and pathways are wide enough for people using
wheelchairs. Ensure that presenters using wheelchairs will be able to
access the stage or podium.

Buffets, snacks, beverages, dining tables, and check-in tables should be within reach
of someone using a wheelchair.

Provide means for people to position themselves more flexibly than in
standard chairs. Pillows and footrests are helpful for chairs. Yoga
mats are helpful if sitting in chairs for long periods is difficult.

There should be some seating available during breaks, even if most people will be standing.

Consider visibly marking seats in meeting and poster rooms and break areas for use by disabled
people.

Restrooms, including gender neutral facilities, should be located near conference rooms and
break areas.
