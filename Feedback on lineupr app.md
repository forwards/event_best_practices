Initial feedback from Liz Hare:

When I followed the link above and then followed the web app link (on iPhone), the page I got had a few links that must have had meaningful images attached to them, but there was no text attached, so I'd have to follow each link and read the resulting page to figure out what they were. They should have text titles. I wasn't able to navigate to the schedule at all.
