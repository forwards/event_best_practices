There were two community contributed apps to help navigate the useR! 2019 schedule. It would be good to get feedback from both sighted and visually impaired useR!s on how these compare to the official useR! 2019 schedule table. Possibly a Shiny app could be used instead/as well as these tables at future useR!s. 

Hallie Swan's Shiny app is on GitHub, she welcomes suggestions/improvements/comments

Mine Cetinkaya-Rundel's Flexdashboard is also on GitHub.

Garrick Aden-Buie's Shiny app is focused on exploring tweets related to the conference, but includes sortable table of the schedule:

As far as I can see the code is not online, but he provides contact details.
 
Source data could be obtained from Heather Turner if anyone wants to extend these apps (e.g. incorporating abstract information or other program information such as breaks and social events).
