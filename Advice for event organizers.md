# Improving the accessibility of your event

The following is a list of recommendations to improve accessibility of your event. Many of the suggestions can be implemented with minimal cost in terms of personnel or money, but require some planning ahead.

## Support for participants with vision impairments

**A formal facility tour:** The rationale was that once an attendee with vision problems has a basic overview of the venue layout, they should be able to navigate with confidence. So making sure that anyone who is interested knows when to attend the tour, at the beginning of the event, would probably be very helpful.  

**Organized walks to the Venue from Satellite Hotels:** The suggestion is that an established time be set from each of the satellite hotels to the main venue in the mornings, and the reverse in the evenings. Navigating in a new city can be difficult. And if an attendee is not outgoing, they might have difficulty finding someone to walk with. This way, there will be an established time and place to meet, and an established guide. The walking buddy will meet the interested attendees on the first day, so they know who will be included in their group.  

**Braille Placards for Food and Exhibit Tables:** Figuring out which food to eat was established as a problem. Having servers helps, but the placards would make blind attendees less reliant on help from the servers or other attendees. Also, the exhibit tables at the NFB conference all had small braille identifiers at the corner of each table. (Always the same corner, so it was easy to find.)  This would probably be a helpful addition to exhibit tables/booths at our conferences. 

**Buddies to assist with food and beverage choices:** Although Braille placards enables blind participants to be more independent, some may still appreciate help navigating food and beverage choices at breaks and buffets. It could be a hotel or catering staff member, or a conference buddy that has volunteered to offer such help.

**Flash talks for poster presentations:** This provides a verbal overview, which is useful for all conference participants to identify presentations of interest, but is particularly beneficial for anyone that cannot access the poster session due to vision or mobility impairments.

**Collect accessible materials for all presentations in advance:** If visually impaired participants have accessible materials (e.g. markdown source) when listening to an oral presentation, it can help them to follow along. In general, participants often ask for materials straight after a talk: if the materials are only collected on the day of the presentation there is often a several-day delay in making the materials available. The deadline for materials should be practical for both presenters and organizers: RSS 2018 asked for slides ~1 week in advance (https://events.rss.org.uk/rss/media/uploaded/EVRSS/event_194/RSS2018_Guidelines_for_Contributed_presentations.pdf), which worked well.

**Provide materials in a conference repository:** The schedule may be hard to navigate for people using screenreaders; providing a repository of slides/other materials can make them more accessible. Potentially participants could contribute their materials directly to the repository rather than using email.

**Link to accessible materials from the videos:** If presentations are recorded, make sure the video descriptions have a link to the accompanying materials.

**Make the schedule accessible:** The schedule of events should be available in a simple electronic format that can be read on a smartphone or computer. PDFs with fancy tables are hard to navigate and sometimes hard to understand.

## Support for participants with hearing impairments

**Provide microphones for all presenters and question-askers:** When speakers decline to use microphones because they feel they can speak loud enough, it's often not loud enough for people with hearing impairments. Therefore speakers, panelists and audience members asking questions should use a microphone even if the session is not being recorded. This should include tutorials and other formal conference events.

**Provide live captioning:** Live captioning by specialised captioners is more accurate than auto-captioning and more universal than sign language. It is also appreciated by hearing participants, especially those for whom the conference language is not their first language. This requires budgeting for early on.

## General

See the NumFOCUS DISCOVER cookbook for more on making the event accessible to all.

**Advertise initiatives taken to make the event accessible:** If inclusion efforts are not advertised, disabled people may assume that the event will not be accesible to them (or no more accesible than the typical scientific conference/tech meetup). Avenues for advertising include: blindRUG, the conference website, https://www.confa11y.com/). In particular, it is far better to put accommodations/facilities etc on the conference website than for people to have to ask.
