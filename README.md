# event_best_practices

Pooled resources on best practices for events (conferences, workshops, RUGS, etc). Work in progress.

This has a lot of overlap with the NumFOCUS DISCOVER cookbook https://discover-cookbook.numfocus.org. We should consider how this fits alongside that, e.g. 
 - contribute ideas back there
 - pull out the minimum measures that we expect useR! conferences to meet (and build on each year)
Currently the DISCOVER cookbook focuses on the logistics of organizing the event, here we are beginning to add advice for presenters to make the content itself more accessible.
