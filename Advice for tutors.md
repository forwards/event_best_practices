**Use the microphone:** Even if you are in a small room and you feel your voice is loud enough, please use the microphone. This enables any participants with hearing impairments to hear you, without having to bring attention to their disability. Similarly, ask audience members to use the roaming microphone when asking a question, or if one is not available, repeat their question so that others can hear.

Advice on slide format would be the same as for speakers.

TODO: add guidance on making the learning activities accessible. Many tutors use different styles: lecture, demo, interactive exercises, group discussions.
