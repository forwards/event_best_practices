Adapted from [Liz’s guidelines](https://github.com/forwards/event_best_practices/blob/master/DRAFTEventBestPracticesDisability0120.md) for the IRL conference.

Dear speaker, 

We recognized that by asking you to share your pre-recorded talk online, we have the opportunity to make useR! 2020’s talk more accessible to R community members with either visual or audible accessibility needs. We therefore would like you to take the following into account, as you prepare your slides, record your video, and prepare accompanying downloadable material for your audience.

When preparing your slides or poster, please consider 
* Avoiding small fonts
* Pay attention to colors that are visible to people with color blindness. In general, high-contrast color schemes are more visible.


When recording your talk,
* Please pace yourself, so the audience can integrate both audio and visual information. Graphics, pictures, videos, and memes should be described audibly.
* Please avoid bright and/or flashing lights or images that could trigger seizures.


When preparing downloadable resources, please consider 
* Submitting your presentation in markdown as it will enable blind people to use screen reading software or braille displays to follow the details (e.g. code) of talks.
Avoiding the small fonts
* Pay attention to colors that are visible to people with color blindness. In general, high-contrast color schemes are more visible.
* Consider submitting a simple copy of your talk with large print so audiences can follow along on screen or print out.
* Consider adding alt-text descriptions for graphics, images, memes, screenshots, and other graphically-presented material.
