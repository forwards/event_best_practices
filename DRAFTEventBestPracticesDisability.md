<h1> Event Best Practices for Disability Inclusion

<h2> Goals of Inclusion

Inclusion goes beyond accessibility.

* Inclusion is for everyone, not just people who request specific types of access.
Participants with invisible disabilities should not have to out themselves. Lots
of people have disabilities and neurodivergence that aren't obvious.

* Everyone is welcome and their contributions valued. Access is not a liabiilty or burden.
The outmoded phrase "special needs" suggests that the need for access is the disabled individual's,
rather than the organizers' responsibility. Avoid euphemisms like "special" and
"challenged" when talking about disability. Be matter of fact, and follow each
individual's preference for how they identify their disability.

<h2> Overall logistics

- The conference website should be accessible to people with various disabilities as
specified in the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG; https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/). It should detail the inclusive practices that will
be used at the conference so people can decide whether the conference will be accessible
to them. There should be a contact listed for questions about
accessibility.

<h2> Sensory Disabilities

- Conference presentations and tutorials are made on both visual
(slides) and auditory (presenter's spoken words) channels. For people with
sensory disabilities, integrating these two channels so that all
information can be understood simultaneously can be difficult without
inclusive practices.

- Sign language interpreting is required for some potential
participants. Since UseR! 2020 is in the United states, ASL (American
sign language) interpreters should be available. For conferences in
other locations, the local sign language mightbe more relevant. Deaf
participants should be able to sit near interpreters, and they should
be able to watch the interpreter, the presenter, and the screen simultaneously.

- Live captioning can provide access to spoken content for some
participants. It could also be used to provide transcripts of talks later.

- The sound system used should have the audio induction loop system that
can send signals directly to hearing aids. The availability of this
system should be posted on a sign at the entrance to the room, along
with specifications if only a certain part of the room is covered.

- Small breakout rooms should be located near the conference sessions
and break areas to provide quiet places for conversations without
background noise.

- Everyone should be required to use a microphone. If it's impractical
to amplify people asking questions, the presenter or moderator should
repeat the questions into a microphone.

- Loud music at events can make it difficult for some to participate.

  
<h2> Presentations

- Requesting presentations early (preferably in markdown) and making
them available electronically will enable blind people to use screen
reading software or braille displays to follow the details (e.g. code)
of talks. Slides should be prepared avoiding the use of small fonts
and attention given to choosing colors that are visible to people with color
blindness. 
- Recommendations can be found on the Perkins School for the
Blind website:
https://www.perkinselearning.org/technology/digital-transitions/creating-accessible-powerpoint-presentations-students-visual

- High-contrast color schemes are more visible.  Large print hard copies
of talks could be more accessible for visually impaired participants.
Alt-text descriptions should be used for graphics, images, memes, screenshots,
and other visually-presented material.

- Presenters should be guided to pace themselves so the audience can
integrate both audio and visual information. Graphics, pictures,
videos, and memes should be described verbally.

  
  
 <h2> General directions/ language
   
- Avoid color-coding conference materials (e.g. "If your swag bag is red, go over there. If it's
blue, go over there." Avoid giving directions by only making gestures and using vague
descriptions like "here" or "there."

   
   
<h2> Inclusive Practices around Food
  
- At meals and breaks, someone should be available to help blind and
visually impaired people to navigate food and beverage
choices. Braille labels can be provided.
  
- Buffets, snacks, beverages, dinind tables, and check-in tables should be within reach
of someone using a wheelchair.
  
- Provide a wide range of foods including gluten- and allergen-free, as
well as vegetarian/vegan, and diabetic options. Make ingredient lists available, and have
someone from the catering service available for questions.

- To avoid contamination with gluten or allergens at buffets, serve each
food on separate plates or containers (e.g. do not contaminate cheese
with crackers). 
  - Place gluten- or allergen-containing foods
later in the buffet so they don't contaminate allergen-free foods
earlier in the sequence.
  - Use the layout or decorations to discourage contamination of utensils

- Lunch and break times should be long enough for people to leave the
conference to get the food they need if it is not available at the
conference.

- Sugar free beverage options (diet soda, etc. and sweetners like Stevia, Equal,
Sweet 'N' Lo) are needed at breaks, as well as plain water.

- If free alcohol is provided, have something other than beer and non-alcoholic options.

  
  
  
  
<h2> Inclusive Physical Space
* This section is weak *

- Ensure that aisles are wide enough for people using
wheelchairs. Ensure that presenters using wheelchairs will be able to
access the stage or podium.

- Restrooms, including gender neutral facilities, should be located near conference rooms and
break areas.

- There should be some seating available during breaks, even if most people will be standing.
  - Provide means for people to position themselves more flexibly than in
standard chairs. Pillows and footrests are helpful for chairs. Yoga
mats are helpful if sitting in chairs for long periods is difficult.
