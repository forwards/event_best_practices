Initial feedback from Liz Hare:

The table was difficult to navigate with the screen reader (VoiceOver on iOS). I can swipe between the elements of the big table, but there isn't a good way to search for text (like, say, a particular date, presenter's name, or talk title. Navigating a large table with a large number of swipes makes it easy for me to lose my place in the document.

When I follow the link on Mac with VoiceOver, it's much easier to navigate the table without losing my place. It would be helpful to have it broken down into smaller chunks, like one page/file per day, or morning or afternoon.

It would be really helpful to have a verbal explanation of the flow. Are certain tracks in certain rooms? Maybe describe what tracks are what day, when there are tracks and when there is only one presentation at a time (at some co inferences part of the time is spent all together at plenary session(s) and there are other periods of breakout sessions). A verbal overview would really save having to read through the whole table to figure out the patterns.

N.B. When asked for a first review, Liz was only sent the link above. There is also a program overview page (http://www.user2019.fr/program_overview/), which may help to give a better idea of the flow.
