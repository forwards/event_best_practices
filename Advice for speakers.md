Advice to make your presentation accessible to visually impaired participants

[This might be motivated by data from the useR! surveys to demonstrate that people with visual impairments do attend useR!. We can also emphasise that the benefit is felt more widely, for example, people at the back of large lecture rooms or people who are live-tweeting or taking notes also benefit from good audio description.]

 - The oral presentation should contain *everything* on the slides. (Don't show your 'Results' graph and say 'a picture is worth a thousand words' and leave it at that. 
 - Give the structure of information verbally ("There were 5 requirements for participation in the study. [Read each one]" 
 - Design graphics with high contrast and with attention to ensuring contrasts are visible to people with various types of colorblindness. [we could expand on this/link to further resources]
 - Add informative alternative text descriptions to graphs, plots, and flow charts (e.g. "X decreases as Y increases" instead of "graph of X and Y"). (Goring et al, 2018, https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/earth-analytics/document-your-science/add-images-to-rmarkdown-report/)
 
TO BE EXPANDED ON:

Provide slides in both markdown and PDF for inclusion on the website *prior* to conference. 

People often have HTML slides these days - if these are deployed on the website, perhaps a link to the HTML version is enough? This happened already for some folks at useR!, e.g. https://www.jumpingrivers.com/t/2019-user-security/#1

I guess we'd still have to give instructions for people using PowerPoint and Keynote - presumably that they supply both the original and PDF version (the latter to ensure it displays correctly on the conference laptop).
