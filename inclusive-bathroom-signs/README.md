Inclusive bathrooms signs are provided here for use at Forwards events. We
encourage their use by others!

The gender-neutral bathroom sign (a simple toilet icon) was designed by
Sam Killerman and downloaded from [his website](http://itspronouncedmetrosexual.com/2014/04/printable-gender-neutral-bathroom-sign-guerilla-project/#).

The accessible icon is an alternative to the 1960's International Symbol of
Access that is often used for accessible bathroom signs. The modern icon shows
the wheelchair user in an active pose. It was designed by Tim Ferguson Sauder,
Brian Glenney and Sara Hendren and was downloaded from
http://accessibleicon.org/.

Both icons are provided here as printable PDF and as separate image files in
case you prefer to add words or otherwise modify the sign.
